Then comes the main part of your work. To lay the ground, there should first be a chapter on what has been done before on the problem - a Literature Review. This is an important section because it shows that you do not narrowly focus only on what you do, but are aware of the
related work elsewhere, some of which might be instructive to your solving the problem. It can also explain why you are taking the direction you do.
