\subsection{Benchmarks}

Some well-labeled datasets for lanes and road marking were collected in work \cite{caltech, lee2017vpgnet}

First, the caltech lane detection dataset \cite{caltech} has 1,225 photos captured in two cities, washington and cordova. It features various types of lanes (straight, curved, paralleled). But this dataset has no label for traffic symbols, and no much photo under extreme weather conditions. Later on, VPGNet \cite{lee2017vpgnet} made improvements on benchmark building. They collected 20,386 images under various weather and illumination conditions. Besides, VPGNet has more information on road markings and vanishing points. It uses 1 channel to label 18 classes of lanes and road markings, and 1 channel for vanishing point information.
