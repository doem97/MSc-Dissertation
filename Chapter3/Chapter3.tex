The next few chapters should describe the work you have done in tackling the problem. There might be a chapter on the fundamental theories relevant to the solution you are pursuing, or the supporting technologies you need in implementing the solution. Then there should be a chapter on the solution itself, followed by a chapter on the results and analysis of the results.
